# acanalysis
A tool to explore/extract Ace Combat 4/5/0's files.

Translated from *https://code.google.com/p/acanalysis/*
 
You can visualise various 3D models from the games, and the texture and image files as well.
Textures are exportable to more standard image files while the 3D export feature is still very experimental ( list of unknown values
stored in a txt file.).
